# harzsperren
A python-based project that downloads, saves, and visualizes the water level gauge of 6 dams in the Harz mountains. The original data are provided in a daily updated pdf-file by the www.harzwasserwerke.de. The code downloads the pdf-files, extracts the data, saves it in a csv-file and deletes the pdf every day at 11:00 am. With the csv.-file it is possíble to analyse the data over longer time periods.
